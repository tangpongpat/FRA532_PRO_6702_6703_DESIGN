## drift concept 

Drifting is make a car oversteering , causing a loss of traction in the rear wheels while maintaining control and driving the car through the entirety of a corner. In this project, we focus on enabling drift by tuning the balance between traction, power, and braking force, especially in rear-wheel drive (RWD) setups.

- In **typical cornering**, front tires steer in the direction of the curve, and rear tires maintain traction.
- In **drift cornering**, the vehicle is rotated into the turn, and the **rear tires are saturated**, sliding outward as the front wheels counter-steer to maintain directional control.
- The vehicle exhibits a **high sideslip angle (β)** and controlled **yaw rate (ψ)**, while lateral acceleration (aᵧ) still points toward the center of the curve.


## Transmisstion system
Originally based on an all-wheel-drive (AWD) layout, the F1TEETH platform has been modified to **rear-wheel drive (RWD)** to improve the ability to break traction at the rear wheels. This configuration allows better control over drifting behavior and enables intentional oversteer, which is essential for sustained drifts.

To achieve this, the **driveshaft connecting the motor to the front wheels was removed**, effectively disabling the front-wheel drive and converting the system into a purely rear-wheel-driven platform.

## Braking System
I chose to use a magnetic braking system because it requires the **least amount of space for installation**, especially compared to traditional servo-based brakes, which are often bulky. The magnetic setup is also **lighter in weight**, making it more suitable for small-scale RC vehicles. Additionally, this design allows for the possibility of implementing **ABS-like behavior**, helping the car come to a stop smoothly and precisely with minimal wheel lock-up.
